Hey all,
We just addded the first version of Wishlist to the MeinsCord!

***How do I wishlist a product?***
When you're logged in to your MeinsCord account visit any project's product page on the MeinsCord Store or MeinsCord Marketplace on the web.
Click on the "Hearth" icon, in the bottom position.

***What can I do with wishlists?***
You can track the products you're interested in for future purchase or discounts, all on one handy page!

To start, we'll be adding filtering and smart searching of items you've added to your wishlist. In future iterations, we plan to add email notifications when your wishlisted titles are discounted, or change status (such as a launch, or becoming available for pre-purchase). 

***How do I view my wishlist?***
You can access your wishlist online by signing in to your MeinsCord account and heading over to [https://www.meinscord.com/wishlist](https://www.meinscord.com/wishlist)

Weâ€™re already planning some improvements for future iterations, but can always use your feedback. Try it out and let us know your thoughts on our social channels!
